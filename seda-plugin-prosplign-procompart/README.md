SEDA ProSplign/ProCompart plugin
======================

This plugin allows the possibility of executing the ProSplign/ProCompart trough the SEDA Graphical User Interface.

By default, the intermediate files generated by this operation in temporary directories are removed. If you need to keep them (e.g. for debugging purposes os in case of unexpected errors), it is possible to keep them by running SEDA with `-Dseda.prospligncompart.keeptemporaryfiles=true`.
