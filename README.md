Features
--------
Among other functions, SEDA allows you to:
- Filter sequences based on different criteria (including text patterns).
- Translate nucleic acid sequences into amino acid sequences.
- Execute BLAST analyses.
- Remove duplicated sequences.
- Sort, merge, split or reformat files.

For programmers
---------------
Programmers can take advantage of the SEDA core to develop new operations to process FASTA files. In addition, SEDA has a plugin-based architecture, so new functions can be added to SEDA through plugins.
